Notes

Description

I released the advising hold on your account so you can go ahead and register for CYBR 6126 and
CPSC 6125. Please note that with CPSC 6125 you fulfill the two electives required by your degree.
If you plan to do an independent study or thesis, we will need to adjust your schedule, so you don't
take extra courses. Let me know if/how your plans change after you hear back from Dr. Abid. Please
note that you have two required courses remaining: CPSC 6179 and CPSC 6109. The plan is that
you will take these in spring 2025 along with CPSC 6000.

Student was advised for upcoming semester and advisor. For fall 2023, student will - Register for
CPSC 6177 - Email Dr. Abid for approval to take CPSC 6121 without taking CPSC 6114 (please
copy me in your email) - Get on the waitlist for CPSC 6119. (The department asked for an increase
in the capacity of the course so hopefully you will be able to take the course in the fall). Please note
that because of your visa status, only one of your courses can be fully online. The section number
will start with V for " virtual" (e.g. V01) for fully online sections.
